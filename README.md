## Inductive HyperGraph and Functional HyperGraph Algorithms

A library for directed hypergraphs based on the inductive graph concept proposed by Martin Erwig, implementing important algorithms for hypergraphs.

Hypergraph in this case is an isomorphic bipartite graph.  

## Current Functionality

Initialization of a hypergraph.

In the future it'll be used for computing the ledger and in the API for SHARNELL Smart Contracts.
